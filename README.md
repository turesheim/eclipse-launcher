## OS X Eclipse Launcher

This feature will add an **Open Workspace** menu item that will detect the application of the running Eclipse instance 
and start another in a fashion similar to the **Switch Workspace** command.

Now with all these Eclipse instances up and running it is probably a good idea to be able to tell them apart. The 
workspace name can be set in **Preferences > General > Workspace** and it will show up in the icon badge. Otherwise the
last segment of the workspace path will be used.

Additionaly it is possible to use the **Advanced...** menu item that allowing you to specify launch options when opening
a new workspace. Using this you can easily debug a new instance of the running IDE without creating a launch 
configuration.

Note that OS X 10.6 or newer is required as this feature relies on the 
[open](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/open.1.html) command's 
ability to pass on arguments.

## Installing

You can install from the <a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/osx-eclipse-launcher">Eclipse Marketplace</a>
or drag <a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/marketplace-client-intro?mpc_install=364668" title="Drag and drop into a
running Eclipse workspace to install OSX Eclipse Launcher">
<img src="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/sites/all/modules/custom/marketplace/images/installbutton.png" 
style="border: 0px; margin:0px; padding:0px; vertical-align:bottom;"/></a> into an running Eclipse instance.

If you have a version older than 3.0 installed you must uninstall this before installing version 3.0 or newer. Go to 
**Eclipse > About Eclipse > Installation Details**, select "OS X Eclipse Launcher Utility" and click **Uninstall...**. 
Automatic update from 2.0 or older to 3.0 or newer will not work and keeping both versions installed will lead to 
unpredictable behaviour.

## Building

Clone the project and from the root execute:

    mvn clean verify
    
When successful there will be a Eclipse p2 repository at *net.resheim.eclipse.launcher-site/target/repository* which you
can install from.
